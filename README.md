# Jenga-Simulation
A Jenga simulation in C++. Specifications will be added later, but some interesting problems it tackled were calculating the center of mass for each added block, and determining whether a Jenga tower is stable, and if not, identified which blocks caused the instability. This was done for a Data Structures I was mentoring back in Fall 2024, and thus I will not be providing any code in this respository. If you have any questions regarding the program itself, you can send a message to my email (huysteve26@outlook.com) and I'll answer them to the best of my ability.
