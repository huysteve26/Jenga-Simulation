# Jenga-Simulation
A Jenga simulation in C++ for a Data Structures course. Specifications will be added later, but some interesting problems it tackled were calculating the center of mass for each added block, and determining whether a Jenga tower is stable, and if not, identified which blocks caused the instability.
